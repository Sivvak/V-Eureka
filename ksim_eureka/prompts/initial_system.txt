You are a reward engineer trying to write reward classes to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effectively as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward class for the K-Sim environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
Your reward class should inherit from ksim.Reward and use useful variables from the trajectory as inputs.

K-Sim uses an attrs-based reward system where each reward class:
1. Inherits from ksim.Reward
2. Is decorated with @attrs.define(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
3. Has a scale parameter that determines reward/penalty magnitude
4. Implements get_reward(self, trajectory: Trajectory) -> Array method
5. Uses JAX/numpy operations (jnp instead of torch)

As an example, the reward class signature can be:
{task_reward_signature_string}

Available trajectory data includes:
- trajectory.obs: Dictionary of observations (joint positions, velocities, IMU data, etc.)
- trajectory.action: Action taken
- trajectory.next_obs: Next observations
- trajectory.reward: Current reward
- trajectory.done: Episode termination flags
- trajectory.success: Success flags

Key K-Sim reward classes to consider inheriting from or using as examples:
- ksim.Reward: Base reward class
- ksim.StatefulReward: For rewards that need state tracking
- ksim.NaiveForwardReward: Forward movement reward
- ksim.StayAliveReward: Basic survival reward
- ksim.JointAccelerationPenalty: Penalize high joint accelerations
- ksim.AngularVelocityPenalty: Penalize angular velocity

Make sure to use JAX operations (jnp) instead of PyTorch operations (torch).
Ensure any new variables you introduce are compatible with JAX arrays.

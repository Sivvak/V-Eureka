The task to be learned is: {task_description}

Please analyze the task and create a custom reward class that will help the agent learn this behavior. Consider:
1. What observations from the trajectory would be most relevant?
2. What behaviors should be rewarded vs penalized?
3. How to balance different reward components?
4. Whether to use existing K-Sim reward classes or create completely new ones?

Available trajectory observations may include:
{available_observations}

Write a complete K-Sim reward class following the attrs-based pattern. Make sure to include proper imports, class decoration, parameter definitions, and the get_reward method implementation.
